# Paula's budget tracker using Ms. Excel
This is a personal project that i have ever posted here on this platform and i am aiming to constantly share the updated progess. 

## Project Aim
To begin with, this project comes as necessisty to me, as a way to develop awareness towards my spending and discipline to track the expenses. 

## Template used
Purely, This was not my initial template, as i was still familiarizing myself with the whole Excel's formula. Therefore, i refered to: 
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhTf_Inf7Fs">Template used</a> with the title of "Take control of your finances in 2025 with excel" by Kenji Explains. 

## Question

2. To calcultate savings rate per month
3. To study variables expenses by differentiating wants and needs

## Process
    # March 5th 2025
- Found a suitable personal budget tracker to modify and adjust it according to my needs, created 2 (two) sheets, Entries and Dashboards.
- One of the significant feature i used In entries sheet is "List" in data validation option to choose category and incorporated it with "Xlookup" formula to automate the Income/Expense based on the chosen categories.
- While in Dashboard sheet, the template seperated Year to Date Monthly breakdown and Year to date categories breakdown, to perceive accurately about my personal income and expenses. In the implemantation of the year to date monthly breakdown, to calculate each monthly spending i used "sumifs" to meet multiple criterias from the Entries sheet, with this formula sums the values in the **'Amount'** column of **Table1**, but only for rows where the **'Month'** matches the value in `Dashboard!B11` and the **'Income / Expense'** type matches `Dashboard!B10`. It helps filter and calculate totals based on selected criteria in the **Dashboard** sheet.
- Also in dashboard sheet, the utilzation of "group" feature is helpful to collapsing and expanding tables.
- Some thoughts: i should learn about color scheme in data visualization,to make it more appealing yet easy to read and to learn present the data in simplest ways
